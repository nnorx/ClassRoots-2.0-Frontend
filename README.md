# ClassRoots-2.0-Frontend

This project is the frontend implementation of ClassRoots, built with [Flutter/Dart](https://flutter.io/).

ClassRoots is a forum application for college students that hosts student-led discussion on the basis of classes selected by the user. The posts are also aggregated into a feed so that the user can browse through all discussions of the classes they are subscribed to.

This application was developed between 2018-2020 and put on hiatus as I graduated college and pursued other goals.
